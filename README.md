# aclo-web

This project was the result of hard work, a lot of enthusiasm and mainly a lot of frustration

## Context

When I started the IronHack part time bootcamp I knew (in theory) how frustrating coding could be, but to experience it in practice was another thing. One day I was struggling with some crazy javascript logic late at night after a full day of work and coding lessons when I thought "You know what? Fuck Off. I quit"

Of course I didn't quit. Mi Stockholm syndrome with coding at that moment was too big. 

I decided to develop an app to help other people to send everything to fuck off. And I did it. 

## Aclo meaning

Aclo means "A tomar por culo" which could mean "I don't give a shit" or "Fuck off". As you prefer. 

## How to use it

Aclo has two main functionalities:
- You can find a place to disappear
- You can find a place to send someone you are very upset with.

IMPORTANT!! 
When you send someone somewhere, that person receives a mail notification, so be careful and think first (at least a little)

## Roadmap (sooner)
- Send "fuckoffs" to people who is not registerd in the platform
- Integration with flights APIs (so you can REALLY leave everything at the moment)
- Web layout improvement (OK. I confess: right now is not "mobile first" is just "only mobile" you can try to see it in your desktop but is kind of a mess. Sorry)

## Roadmap (later)
- Login with social media and other security measurments related with login and register
- Add custom messages to your hated ones
- Improved stats (to show you your level of frustration in relation with how many times you use the platform)
